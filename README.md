# BATPOWER04C

Step-down voltage converter module uses [LM3485](doc/pdf/lm3485.pdf) PFET Buck controller. Acceptable input voltage range is 4.5 V - 16V. Output voltage can be selected by jumper in fixed values of 3,3V, 5V or custom voltage by external resistor or trimmer. The output supply voltage can be chosen in the range of 0.25 to Vin voltage. This module is especially suited for battery powered applications. But it can be used as an step-down converter from external 12V to 3.3V or 5V for your MLAB design that requires this power supply. Its key feature is its high efficiency (up to 93%), which will not produce waste heat.
